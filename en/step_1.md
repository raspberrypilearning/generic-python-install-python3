If Python 3 or IDLE isn't installed on you computer, follow the installation instructions below for your operating system.

**IDLE** is a standard interactive development environment for writing and executing Python code that you will use in many of our Python projects.

### Microsoft Windows

+ Open your web browser and navigate to [www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads).

+ On this webpage, you will see a button to install the latest version of Python 3. Click it, and a download will start automatically.

+ When it's complete, click **Close**.

+ Open IDLE from your Applications.

### Linux (Debian-based distributions)

Most distributions of Linux come with Python 3 already installed, but they might not have IDLE installed. Use `apt` to check whether they are installed and install if them if they aren't.

+ Open up a terminal window and type:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 idle3
```

This will install IDLE (and Python 3), and you should then be able to find it in your Application menu.
